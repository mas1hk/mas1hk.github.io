# Background

*  At the time of this project I had just acquired a bike to ride around campus. The goal of this project was to leverage my fabrication skills to create a phone mount for this bike as quickly as possible. As part of a previous project, I had already created a phone case model for my current phone. Using the top-down modelling approach I built the mount around my bike's handlebars and the phone itself. Doing this I was able to project geometries and design a bike mount and mating joint quickly by building my components of other parts. After doing this all that was left to do was 3D print the parts and test it out! 

# Features

* **Easy to mount phone holder** A 3D printed phone holder that mounts to the handlebar using two screws. The oval geometry of the piece allows it to fit a range of handlebars between 32-36mm. The mount is made from ABS, a strong, hard and durable plastic well-suited for the wear and tear associated with riding. The square fitting allows the phone to be placed both vertically or horizontally.  
* **Custom 3D printed phone case** A custom 3D printed phone case is used to fit the phone on the bike. The phone case was designed based on Apple's schematics for the curvature of the iPhone X (the phone model I currently own). The case was made from TPU which is flexible and durable plastic chosen so that the case can stretch around the phone gripping it tight.

# Assembly Instructions 

* Screw the bike mount around the handlebars. Tighten the screws until pressed firmly against the handlebars such that there is no rotation of the mount.  
* Slide the square extrusion on the back of the phone case into the middle of the opening on the mount.
